# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain
## Description
Developed a Power BI dashboard to investigate a decline in market share and revenue using three months of hotel booking data. The dashboard highlighted underperforming areas and empowered the revenue team to implement focused improvements. Key metrics like Revenue, ADR, and Week-over-Week (WoW) changes are visualized to support performance tracking.
## Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  
‚Ä¢	üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for report creation.  
‚Ä¢	üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.  
‚Ä¢	üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.  
‚Ä¢	üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established among tables.  
## Features / Highlights  
### Business Problem    
The hospitality industry often struggles with fluctuating occupancy rates, declining revenue, and ineffective pricing strategies across hotel properties. The revenue management team lacked a centralized, data-driven view to compare hotel performance and uncover underperforming areas.  
Key questions such as:  
‚Ä¢ Which hotels or room types are underperforming week over week?  
‚Ä¢ How do revenue and occupancy trends differ by region or season?  
‚Ä¢ What is the trend in ADR, RevPAR, and DSRN across properties? 

### Goal of the Dashboard  
To design an interactive Power BI dashboard that:  
‚Ä¢ Consolidates three months of hotel booking data across multiple properties.  
‚Ä¢ Enables dynamic filtering by hotel, room type, and time period.  
‚Ä¢ Visualizes key KPIs including Revenue, Occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, and WoW changes.  
‚Ä¢ Supports the revenue team in monitoring performance and making data-driven decisions to recover lost market share.  

### Walkthrough of Key Visuals
#### KPI Overview (Top Cards)
Displays high-level metrics such as Total Revenue, Occupancy Rate, ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), and DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights).
#### WoW Performance Trends (Line Charts)
Line visuals track week-over-week trends for Revenue, ADR, and Occupancy, helping identify seasonality, performance dips, and recovery patterns.
#### Hotel-Level Breakdown (Bar/Column Charts)
Visuals highlight top and bottom performing hotels based on revenue and occupancy. Helps in benchmarking and identifying underachieving locations.
#### Room Type Performance (Stacked Bars & Matrix Tables)

#### Interactive Filters (Slicers)
Users can dynamically filter visuals by Hotel Name, Room Type, and Date Range to conduct focused performance reviews.

### Business Impact & Insights
